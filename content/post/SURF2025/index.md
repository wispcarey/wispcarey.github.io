## Overview

The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program is one of the "crown jewels" of Caltech. Since 1979, SURF students have had the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of experienced mentors working at the frontier of their fields.

In 2025, I will serve as a mentor in the SURF program, co-mentoring alongside CMS postdoctoral researcher [George Stepaniants](https://georgestepaniants.com/). Together, we will guide a team of 2 to 3 undergraduate students.

## Research Focus

The research project in the SURF program will address accessible yet meaningful problems in data assimilation (DA), particularly in combining DA with machine learning methods. The project is designed to be manageable, and I will provide detailed guidance, including theoretical background in both DA and ML, as well as relevant code resources. 

My hope is to collaborate closely with the students to produce a research paper by the end of the project. However, if our results are not substantial enough for a publication, that is completely fine. My primary goal is for students to gain a solid understanding and valuable skills in DA and ML. Ultimately, if you walk away from this project having learned a great deal, I will consider it a success.

## Expectations for Students

My primary expectation is that you bring genuine enthusiasm to this project. Please make sure that the general research direction outlined above aligns with your interests and that youâ€™re willing to dedicate time and effort to it over the summer of 2025. 

In terms of skills, I hope you have a foundational understanding of probability, stochastic processes, (ordinary) differential equations, and linear algebraâ€”ideally having taken coursework in these areas. Coding proficiency is also important; Python experience is essential, and familiarity with or experience in PyTorch is a plus, though not requiredâ€”Iâ€™m happy to provide guidance on this if needed.

Passion and curiosity are the key qualities Iâ€™m looking for. If youâ€™re excited about this topic and ready to engage deeply, I believe youâ€™ll find this project both rewarding and educational.
