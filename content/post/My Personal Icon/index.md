## Overview

This personal icon is a unique design created independently by me, Bohan Chen, inspired by symbols from mathematics. The concept combines the symbols ∑ (Sigma), π (Pi), and ∫ (Integral) into one cohesive form. In my design, the Sigma symbol transforms seamlessly into the shape of an integral sign, which cleverly intertwines to resemble the shape of Pi. This integration of mathematical symbols not only represents my affinity for mathematics but also serves as a distinctive representation of my identity, Bohan Chen.

## Use and Purpose

This icon is currently used as the symbol for my personal website and will also be incorporated into other platforms and contexts as a recognizable personal mark that represents me, Bohan Chen.
