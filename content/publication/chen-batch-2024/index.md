abstract: Graph learning, when used as a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method, performs
  well for classification tasks with a low label rate. We provide a graph-based batch
  active learning pipeline for pixel/patch neighborhood multi- or hyperspectral image
  segmentation. Our batch active learning approach selects a collection of unlabeled
  pixels that satisfy a graph local maximum constraint for the active learning acquisition
  function that determines the relative importance of each pixel to the classification.
  This work builds on recent advances in the design of novel active learning acquisition
  functions (e.g., the Model Change approach in arXiv:2110.07739) while adding important
  further developments including patch-neighborhood image analysis and batch active
  learning methods to further increase the accuracy and greatly increase the computational
  efficiency of these methods. In addition to improvements in the accuracy, our approach
  can greatly reduce the number of labeled pixels needed to achieve the same level
  of the accuracy based on randomly selected labeled pixels.
