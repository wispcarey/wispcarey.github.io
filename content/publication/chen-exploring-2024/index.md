abstract: 'Graph-based machine learning is a powerful framework for analyzing and
  understanding complex data structures in various domains. This thesis introduces
  novel graph-based methods in multiple image analysis tasks, including classification,
  segmentation, and unmixing, as well as their application in enhancing large language
  models. The key contributions include: (1) the development of new core-set selection
  and batch active learning methods that significantly improve the efficiency of graph-based
  active learning while maintaining its effectiveness; (2) the integration of graph
  learning, active learning, and advanced feature embedding methods to construct pipelines
  for SAR image classification and multi- or hyperspectral image segmentation, outperforming
  neural network-based classifiers or segmenters in semi-supervised learning tasks
  with limited training data; (3) the incorporation of graph-based regularization
  into the optimization problem of hyperspectral unmixing, enabling the utilization
  of a small amount of labeled pixels to greatly improve the performance compared
  to blind unmixing; and (4) the extension of graph Laplacian-based methods to automatically
  construct knowledge graphs in combination with large language models, enhancing
  their information retrieval and response generation capabilities.The proposed methods
  showcase the effectiveness and versatility of graph-based approaches in addressing
  challenges such as limited labeled data, computational efficiency, and knowledge
  representation. The thesis demonstrates the potential of graph-based methods in
  pushing the boundaries of image and document analysis and their applicability in
  a wide range of machine learning problems.'
