abstract: Traditional methods of linking large language models (LLMs) to knowledge
  bases via the semantic similarity search often fall short of capturing complex relational
  dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoKG, a lightweight and efficient
  approach for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. For a given knowledge
  base consisting of text blocks, AutoKG first extracts keywords using a LLM and then
  evaluates the relationship weight between each pair of keywords using graph Laplace
  learning. We employ a hybrid search scheme combining vector similarity and graph-based
  associations to enrich LLM responses. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that AutoKG
  offers a more comprehensive and interconnected knowledge retrieval mechanism compared
  to the semantic similarity search, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in
  generating more insightful and relevant outputs.
