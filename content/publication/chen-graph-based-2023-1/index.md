abstract: We develop a graph active learning pipeline (GAP) to detect surface water
  and in-river sediment pixels in satellite images. The active learning approach is
  applied within the training process to optimally select specific pixels to generate
  a hand-labeled training set. Our method obtains higher accuracy with far fewer training
  pixels than both standard and deep learning models. According to our experiments,
  our GAP trained on a set of 3270 pixels reaches a better accuracy than the neural
  network method trained on 2.1 million pixels.
