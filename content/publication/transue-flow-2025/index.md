abstract: This work introduces the ensemble flow filter (EnFF), a training-free data
  assimilation framework based on flow matching. EnFF uses Monte Carlo estimators
  for the marginal flow field and localized guidance to assimilate observations, and
  it leverages a flow design aligned with Bayesian DA. The method generalizes classical
  filters (e.g., bootstrap particle filter and ensemble Kalman filter) and, on high-dimensional
  benchmarks, shows improved cost–accuracy trade-offs and scalability, highlighting
  flow matching as a practical tool for efficient DA.
