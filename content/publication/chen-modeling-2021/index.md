abstract: Deforestation is a major threat to global environmental wellness, with illegal
  logging as one of the major causes. Recently, there has been increased effort to
  model environmental crime, with the goal of assisting law enforcement agencies in
  deterring these activities. We present a continuous model for illegal logging applicable
  to arbitrary domains. We model the practice of criminals under influence of law
  enforcement agencies using tools from multiobjective optimal control theory and
  consider non-instantaneous logging events and load-dependent travel velocity. We
  calibrate our model using real deforestation data from the Brazilian rainforest
  and demonstrate the importance of geographically targeted patrol strategies.
