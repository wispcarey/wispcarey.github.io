abstract: This chapter presents a novel point process model for COVID-19 transmissionâ€”the
  multivariate recursive Hawkes process, which is an extension of the recursive Hawkes
  model to the multivariate case. Equivalently the model can be viewed as an extension
  of the multivariate Hawkes model to allow for varying productivity as in the recursive
  model. Several theoretical properties of this process are stated and proved, including
  the existence of the multivariate recursive counting process and formulas for the
  mean and variance. EM-based algorithms are explored for estimating parameters of
  parametric and semi-parametric forms of the model. Additionally, an algorithm is
  presented to reconstruct the process from imprecise event times. The performance
  of the algorithms on both synthetic and real COVID-19 data sets is illustrated through
  several experiments.
