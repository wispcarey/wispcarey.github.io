abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) is an effective tool to ascertain the material
  composition of each pixel in a hyperspectral image with typically hundreds of spectral
  channels. In this article, we propose two graph-based semisupervised unmixing methods.
  The first one directly applies graph learning to the unmixing problem, while the
  second one solves an optimization problem that combines the linear unmixing model
  and a graph-based regularization term. Following a semisupervised framework, our
  methods require a very small number of training pixels that can be selected by a
  graph-based active learning method. We assume to obtain the ground-truth information
  at these selected pixels, which can be either the exact (EXT) abundance value or
  the one-hot (OH) pseudo-label. In practice, the latter is much easier to obtain,
  which can be achieved by minimally involving a human in the loop. Compared with
  other popular blind unmixing methods, our methods significantly improve performance
  with minimal supervision. Specifically, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed
  methods improve the state-of-the-art blind unmixing approaches by 50% or more using
  only 0.4% of training pixels.
