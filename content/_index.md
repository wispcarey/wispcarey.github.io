      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |
         My current research focuses on learning-based filtering processes in [data assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_assimilation) problems. Additionally, I am exploring machine learning theorems for [attention mechanisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_(machine_learning)) on measures.

         Previously, I explored various topics in graph-based machine learning and active learning, applying these methods to semi-supervised learning tasks to reduce reliance on traditional data-hungry approaches. These tasks often involve training with scarce ground-truth information, such as manually labeled remote sensing data by LANL experts, SAR image classification, and hyperspectral unmixing.

         If youâ€™re interested in these topics, feel free to reach out to collaborate ðŸ˜ƒ
