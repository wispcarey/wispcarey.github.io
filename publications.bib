	abstract = {Deforestation is a major threat to global environmental wellness, with illegal logging as one of the major causes. Recently, there has been increased effort to model environmental crime, with the goal of assisting law enforcement agencies in deterring these activities. We present a continuous model for illegal logging applicable to arbitrary domains. We model the practice of criminals under influence of law enforcement agencies using tools from multiobjective optimal control theory and consider non-instantaneous logging events and load-dependent travel velocity. We calibrate our model using real deforestation data from the Brazilian rainforest and demonstrate the importance of geographically targeted patrol strategies.},

	abstract = {Active learning improves the performance of machine learning methods by judiciously selecting a limited number of unlabeled data points to query for labels, with the aim of maximally improving the underlying classifiers performance. Recent gains have been made using sequential active learning for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data.1 In each iteration, sequential active learning selects a query set of size one while batch active learning selects a query set of multiple datapoints. While batch active learning methods exhibit greater efficiency, the challenge lies in maintaining model accuracy relative to sequential active learning methods. We developed a novel, two-part approach for batch active learning: Dijkstra’s Annulus Core-Set (DAC) for core-set generation and LocalMax for batch sampling. The batch active learning process that combines DAC and LocalMax achieves nearly identical accuracy as sequential active learning but is more efficient, proportional to the batch size. As an application, a pipeline is built based on transfer learning feature embedding, graph learning, DAC, and LocalMax to classify the FUSAR-Ship and OpenSARShip datasets. Our pipeline outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-based methods.},

	abstract = {Traditional methods of linking large language models (LLMs) to knowledge bases via the semantic similarity search often fall short of capturing complex relational dynamics. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoKG, a lightweight and efficient approach for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. For a given knowledge base consisting of text blocks, AutoKG first extracts keywords using a LLM and then evaluates the relationship weight between each pair of keywords using graph Laplace learning. We employ a hybrid search scheme combining vector similarity and graph-based associations to enrich LLM responses. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that AutoKG offers a more comprehensive and interconnected knowledge retrieval mechanism compared to the semantic similarity search, thereby enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in generating more insightful and relevant outputs.},

	abstract = {Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) is an effective tool to ascertain the material composition of each pixel in a hyperspectral image with typically hundreds of spectral channels. In this article, we propose two graph-based semisupervised unmixing methods. The first one directly applies graph learning to the unmixing problem, while the second one solves an optimization problem that combines the linear unmixing model and a graph-based regularization term. Following a semisupervised framework, our methods require a very small number of training pixels that can be selected by a graph-based active learning method. We assume to obtain the ground-truth information at these selected pixels, which can be either the exact (EXT) abundance value or the one-hot (OH) pseudo-label. In practice, the latter is much easier to obtain, which can be achieved by minimally involving a human in the loop. Compared with other popular blind unmixing methods, our methods significantly improve performance with minimal supervision. Specifically, the experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods improve the state-of-the-art blind unmixing approaches by 50\% or more using only 0.4\% of training pixels.},

We provide a graph-based batch active learning pipeline for pixel/patch neighborhood multi- or hyperspectral image segmentation. Our batch active learning approach selects a collection of unlabeled pixels that satisfy a graph local maximum constraint for the active learning acquisition function that determines the relative importance of each pixel to the classification. This work builds on recent advances in the design of novel active learning acquisition functions (e.g., the Model Change approach in arXiv:2110.07739) while adding important further developments including patch-neighborhood image analysis and batch active learning methods to further increase the accuracy and greatly increase the computational efficiency of these methods. In addition to improvements in the accuracy, our approach can greatly reduce the number of labeled pixels needed to achieve the same level of the accuracy based on randomly selected labeled pixels.},

Equivalently the model can be viewed as an extension of the multivariate Hawkes model to allow for varying productivity as in the recursive model. Several theoretical properties of this process are stated and proved, including the existence of the multivariate recursive counting process and formulas for the mean and variance. EM-based algorithms are explored for estimating parameters of parametric and semi-parametric forms of the model. Additionally, an algorithm is presented to reconstruct the process from imprecise event times. The performance of the algorithms on both synthetic and real COVID-19 data sets is illustrated through several experiments.},

The images contain materials with high intraclass variability and significant mixing.
